# Read -> Translate -> Say

Project in order to use some Cognitive Services API's from Azure Cloud other deployment tools.

## Architecture

For the better explaining of the application, I'll describe each in divided sections below.

### Front End

For the development of the front end, we used a famous web development framework called [Angular](https://angular.io/), which
makes it really straight forward to come with a whole app. For the CSS, we used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), for making
styling faster.

### Back End

For the development of the server, that receives the call with the image and creates all the calls to Azure API's, we search a really
simple and powerful solution. The tool that best fits this need was [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a microframework that is really simple
to put things up and running and can get as huge and powerful as you want.
