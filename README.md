Project in order to use some Cognitive Services API's from Azure Cloud other deployment tools.

## Architecture
For the better explaining of the application, I'll describe each in divided sections below.

### Front End
For the development of the front end, we used a famous web development framework called [Angular](https://angular.io/), which 
makes it really straight forward to come with a whole app. For the CSS, we used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), for making
things faster.
